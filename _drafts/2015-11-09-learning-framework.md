## You've never used an Application Framework before, WHAT?!

Let me now introduce myself. My name is Colin But. I'm a Senior Java Developer at Solarcentury. This is the first ever blog i have written in my whole entire life. I kid you not.
Over the course of many months to come, i will be writing more technically focused articles where i will be sharing with you some of the interesting pieces of work our team have been working on. Watch this space! But for this first blog i'd thought i share with you one my first experiences when i first came into Solarcentury. It is based on an interesting conversation i had with a (now ex) colleague.

> Colleague: What application framework have you used before?  
> Me: I haven't used one before  
> Colleague: Really?!  
> Me: Yes! Really!

He was surprised and shocked. I wasn't.

He couldn't believe that i have had no prior experiences in working with any kind of application frameworks considering my past experiences. Having come from a private software consultancy background myself where i have been developing high scale completely backend distributed enterprise real-time low latency systems, using an application framework was simply a no-no. In those kind of systems, performance is key and ultimate control is the holy grail.

Frameworks tend to be heavyweight.

In Solarcentury, we develop e-commerce web applications. Our system is not just backend, but Fullstack. Here, right now, we are using Spring Framework. I have learnt so much of this framework since i've been here. It is really enjoyable.

Its state of the art IoC container for doing Dependency Injection is immense. I no longer need to manually hand write dependencies. I no longer need to write huge amount of needless boilerplate code (numerous repeated try/catches & useless JDBC data access code.. just to name a few). Spring support for these is top draw (@ExceptionHandler & @ControllerAdvice together giving clear separation of concerns and Spring Data JPA abstraction over raw JDBC - how cool!). Spring Framework is just so big and complex. You simply cannot use every feature of it - it just doesn't make sense. That is because, Spring's philosophy builds upon providing multiple options to do a single thing.

Having used Spring for over 6 months now, i can now understand not just how powerful this framework is but also how it can be benifitual to us:   

- Write less code, Deliver more  
- Write less BOILERPLATE code!   
- Increase developer productivity   
- Faster development speed   
- Focus on solving business problems   

Spring is perfect for developing these kinds of systems.

I definitely recommend getting up to speed and start using an application framework. Of course, it depends on the type of system you're building. I have absolutely enjoyed using it during development.
