##Exciting!

Isn't it? But first let me introduce myself. My name's Michael and i'm from Greece (yeahhh that magical place). 
So, that feeling when you become part of team that works to deliver software. You feel like i'm gonna give the 
best out of me knowing lots of technologies and having a certain level of experience.

But there's one thing we developers always forget, having to compromise with previous parts of code given that 
a project might be huge. You want to change things, but this isn't always something easy. Been with the dev team 
a couple of months now, and the most important for me is team com. That way you can progress easily, learn the 
way that the team moves and you'll definately have the chance to do it your way and contribute significantly to 
a task and the quality of code.

Ohhh and a hint:

>“Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.”

Just kidding.

Surrounded by people like you is great! You have the chance to share a lot of things and most importantly 
collaborate for the common goal; make something work and go home happy.
