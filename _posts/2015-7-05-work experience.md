##Work Experience!

Hello. 

This is my 7th day on work experience here and so far it’s been a fascinating journey, learning names, coding <del>and looking at GIFs</del>.

Armed with basic research on making websites using HTML and Google; the first tasks I Undertook was too make google charts based on the instructions page and data about the Ikea calculator. Of cause the harder part was figuring out how to put multiple charts on one page (which proved to be beyond me, so I eventually consulted the infinite wisdom of Google).  Later on, I used CSS to make the pages look like a half decent website and spent many more hours frustratingly trying to make things go where I wanted. <i>Layouts are a nightmare.</i>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--8xLeading" style="background-image: url('{{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}web.PNG');"></div>

After a certain point, my God awful layout became, only slightly awful and I called it a day to move on to the navigation bar. But before that, I have an even greater and confusing task to do, JQuery posts. This was another thing I have never seen before. As the others say “Googling is half the work” and I now have substantial evidence to back up that claim. Granted, mistakes were made; my thing didn’t work and it took Dom to come and debug it but, I blame IE for having confusing inspect systems.

Sadly, I am but a mere human and could not resist the urge to using my new found knowledge and time to make my inner most stupid ideas come true.

Thus born the ‘Zenyatta is amazing’ shrine and its follow up page: spinning Gandhi with sunglasses.

More time and effort was spent on those than what was probably appropriate but I’ve gotta be the very best at terrible ideas.
