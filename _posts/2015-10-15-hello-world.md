##An Introduction

Hello! My name's Dom Starkey and I'm the Lead Software Engineer at [Solarcentury](http://www.solarcentury.com).

<blockquote class="largeQuote">“All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.” - Walt Disney</blockquote>

Solarcentury has a Software Development team made up of 8 engineers working on a wide variety of projects.

<blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">“Mickey Mouse popped out of my mind onto a drawing pad 20 years ago on a train ride from Manhattan to Hollywood at a time when business fortunes of my brother Roy and myself were at lowest ebb and disaster seemed right around the corner.” <br/>- Walt Disney</blockquote>


<p class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">“Hoping to find work outside the Chicago O-Zell factory, Walt moved back to Kansas City in 1919 to begin his artistic career.” He considered becoming an actor, but decided to draw political caricatures or comic strips for a newspaper. When nobody wanted to hire him as either an artist or as an ambulance driver, his brother Roy, then working in a local bank, got Walt a temporary job through a bank colleague at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio, where he created advertisements for newspapers, magazines, and movie theaters. At Pesmen-Rubin he met cartoonist Ubbe Iwerks and, when their time at the studio expired, they decided to start their own commercial company together.</p>
