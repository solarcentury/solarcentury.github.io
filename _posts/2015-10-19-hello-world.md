##An Introduction

Hello! My name's Dom Starkey and I'm the Lead Software Developer at [Solarcentury](http://www.solarcentury.com). Over the past three years, we've been building a small team of Java and PHP developers to work on a wide range of internal software projects.

<blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">“Software developers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own.”</blockquote>

Throughout that time, we've learnt and improved how we best work as a team, as well as updated, upgraded and generally refreshed a large number of websites and tools used by the company and our customers. We've also discovered that we really love gifs...

So we're starting a blog. I'm not sure what'll be in it yet but I expect we'll be talking about some of the following:

-	The dos and don'ts of moving from Struts to Spring
-	How we got on when we tried to learn Drupal
-	Why are we learning Drupal anyway?
-	What is the best celebration gif?

We also have fortnightly team learning sessions so I'll write up what we've been reading, discussing or making (this blog was the product of one of these sessions!).

Luckily for the reader, it won't just be me writing - We'll have contributions from the whole team, particularly on new or interesting pieces of work. Hope to see you soon!
